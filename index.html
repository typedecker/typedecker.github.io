			  had finally turned into more than just that. Thanks for giving my life a meaning. You mean the world to me.

			Never knew a small piece of text, describing the likes and dislikes of a person, would be something I'd have memorized in my head. Never thought I'd wanna know everything a person likes.
			Never thought anyone would agree with the things I am into, and be with me through thick and thin, always appreciating every lil bit of my effort. You.. Angela, are a fucking angel. Just
			like your name suggests and, I am happy to have met this angel in my life 🧡💜.

			In you, I found that one missing element I needed to complete myself. An everlasting partner. A trustworthy soulmate. A lovely companion.
			and.. most importantly... An angelic kind softhearted cute amazing soul. Ahaha fine. fine. i wont turn this into the japanese jugemo name meme! But ilysm I think you get it by now!

			When we first met, you found it based of me to hate jjk AHAHAHAH! But overtime, you tried understanding my side of all of it, and

			or mighty about it. You're the most down to earth, and lovely soul I've seen 🧡.

			I have so many golden memories, of us both together, I wanted to include more, and my heart and my love for you certainly has it all,
			unfortunately I could not include every single one of them, but I hope you love this gift I made just for you 🧡! I put in alot of 
			effort to make this the best I've ever done for anyone, and I think you deserve that, cuz after all, you did just the same for me,
			and you always have, and this? think of this as a request to keep blessing me with your existence. Smile everyday, for me. Grow everyday, for me.
			Be happy everyday, for me. May god bless you, your future, your doggies, your cuteness, may it all keep growing in the years to come!
			You silly naughty, manga reading, sorry saying, cuteness distributing, never-ever-betraying, always-so-caring pack of goofness! I wish you
			a happy birthday from my end, from the end of yours one and only... Adi🧡 ~ Adi
